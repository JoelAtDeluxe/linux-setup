# linux-setup

Ansible scripts to help me set up my personal linux set up, targeting:

* Ubuntu 18.04
* Fedora 28

## Pre-reqs for Fedora
There are some setup requirements for the script to actually work

* Install:
    * python2-dnf
    * ansible (at the time of this writting, the current version is 2.5.2)
